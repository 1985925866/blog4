      <description>This Hugo theme was ported from Ivy, a minimalist website generator built in Python. I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to document this theme. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. All I can say for now is that I love it. It is clean, minimal, and responsive.
I hope you will enjoy this theme. The source code is on Github. Happy hacking!</description>

      <description>To me, the two most impressive websites based on blogdown are:
Rob J Hyndman&amp;rsquo;s personal website. Live Free or Dichotomize by Lucy and Nick et al. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be more.</description>
